excerpt: 'First, under the setting of covariate shift, we formulate the problem from a perspective of causality and present the identifiability assumptions for the reward induced by a given policy. Then, we derive the efficient influence function and the semiparametric efficiency bound for the reward. Based on this, we construct a doubly robust and semiparametric efficient estimator for the reward and then learn the optimal policy by optimizing the estimated reward. Moreover, we theoretically analyze the bias and the generalization error bound for the learned policy. Furthermore, in the presence of both covariate and concept shifts, we propose a novel sensitivity analysis method to evaluate the robustness of the proposed policy learning approach.'
