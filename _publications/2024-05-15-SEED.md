title: "Stepwise Reasoning Error Disruption Attack of LLMs"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-03-20-example-paper
excerpt: 'The SEED attack subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction.'
