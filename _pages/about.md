Ruocheng Guo is a Staff Research Scientist at Intuit AI Research. His current research interest includes LLMs as causal world models, tool-using agents, LLM reasoning, and causal machine learning.

Prior to joining Intuit, he was a ML Researcher at TikTok/ByteDance Research (London) and an Assistant Professor at City University of Hong Kong. He earned his Ph.D. degree from the Data Mining and Machine Learning Laboratory (DMML) at Arizona State University, advised by [Huan Liu](https://search.asu.edu/profile/255975), MSc degree from the beautiful HKUST and BEng degree from HUST.

Research Interests:
- LLMs (Text World Models, Tool-using Agents, Reasoning)
- Causal ML
- Data Mining
